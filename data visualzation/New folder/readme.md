# PISA-DATA-visualization

Research Design, Method and Dataset
The Dataset is collected from PISA official website. This is an open source dataset that researchers can investigate students’ performance and various factors. One of the Challenge to do data wrangling is that PISA original dataset is full of Code to save space. I use Python and Pandas library to change the features to recognizable names. The PISA measures the student’s Math score, Reading score, and Science scores through various difficulty level. The test scores traditionally were considered to estimate an individual’s cognitive ability(Niederle & Vesterlund, 2010), which means math test scores are a good indicator of students’ performance. Therefore, I used Python to calculate the average grade for each kind of test on multiple levels of difficulties. Then, I use multiplot and seaborn to draw the distribution for each test. The graph shows that these three tests show normal distribution with a similar median grade at around 450 out of 1000. Then, I draw the pair-by-pair representation graph for these three scores. These are a strong positive correlation between these three types of exam scores. Therefore, I just chose the math score at the indicator of students’ educational performance since the math grade is a good indicator of knowledge, logic, and performance. Then, I delete the duplicate rows and check the layout of the remaining dataframe. To decrease the regional effect, I create a new dataset by group by the data where the country label is equal to the United States. To avoid the impact of outlines, I used Violin plots with 25%, 50%, and 75% lines to show the shape of grade distributions.

Anticipated Results of Influential Factors
There are over 600 various features that PISA measure to determine the factors that are attributed to students’ performance. This paper focused on the Mother’s impact, the regional impact, student interest, and gender impact on students’ education qualities. 
Mother’s effect on Children
Family environment and parents are important factors affecting the development of children, no matter how perfect the development of our preschool education, no matter how good the early education institutions, parents are still the most critical experts in the cultivation of young children's wisdom and ideas, the family is also one of the essential environments. So to create a loving, warm, harmonious environment for children, young parents also work hard, and strive to improve themselves, self-education is a process of continuous progress, parents only in the persistence of self-education can give children a good example, with their behavior to influence children, and children grow together.
Full-time mother.
From the dataset, there is a strong correlation between mother at home and students’ math grade. Students with their mother staying at home tend to have 80 more scores than other students. Moreover, we can find that male students tend to have better grades than the female student when their mothers choose to stay at home. In some countries, teenage boys would like to spend more time with their friends after school. If their mothers decide to stay at home, students might not spend too much time doing extracurricular activities. Some mothers could help their children to finish schoolwork on time. Some Japanese family education inherits Confucianism, attaches importance to the family education, attaches particular importance to the role of mothers in cultivating children in the family, and correctly implements the retirement system for women to marry and reproduce, which effectively guarantees the development of family education. In Japan, working women have to resign in their lifetime, and the Government encourages women to go home and take their children. If a woman takes a child at home full-time, the government will subsidize it and will reduce the husband's income tax, and the husband's company must also purchase the appropriate health insurance for the whole family. In the 50 and 60, about 90% of married women were full-time housewives. 
 
Mother’s Education Level 
From the general data, students’ average math grades have a strong positive relationship with their mothers’ education level. Parents with a higher educational level would have a better understanding of the importance of education. The graph shows the evidence that links mothers' educational attainment to children's academic outcomes. We believe that the level of knowledge of parents and their children's academic On the relationship between, may be subject to learning to intervene in this intermediary factor Effect. For example, I found that the higher the level, the better the child's academic performance is usually, and the educated lever. A lower educational background parent is often less involved in the student's studies. Similarly, the level of education of mothers is a contribution to their children's studies. The impact is significant, and the main reason for this may be that their mothers tend to stay at home. Mothers who intervene in the child's study, take more responsibility for educating children and tutoring them in their homework. 
 

Teachers’ Effect on Education 
Different types of Teachers
These are various type of teaching types. Some teachers would like to encourage students to discuss the questions openly in class, while others would like to let students focus on the lecture. From the dataset, PISA measures the teachers’ performance by question students’ idea towards their teachers. 
  
  
Teacher-Student relationship
PISA database records that rating from the student for their teacher to measure the relationship between student and teacher. Throughout the scatter plots, there is a positive correlation between teacher-student-relationship and average student scores. However, we also find there is a slightly negative effect of teacher behavior. It might mean that a teacher’s touch can increase students’ math grade. For the countries where grades determine students’ future universities, or jobs, or career path, using touch teaching styles could help students. When students pay more attention in math class, more students will get higher scores for the math test. Moreover, the attention seems to be primary keys to improve the math score for male students. 
  
 

Wealth and countries
Wealth and region are the significant impacts on the students’ grade performance. People in a wealthy family can go the school with high educational quality. Countries where there is no proper education system or educational atmosphere.
Wealth 
Children with better family backgrounds are more likely to attend higher quality schools, universities and have more extensive resources in employment, which can lead to a slower flow of wealth between different segments of society and solidify social strata. As far as the modern social phenomenon is concerned, for primary education, wealthy families can pay for expensive school district houses, allowing their children to enroll in better primary, secondary and even kindergarten. Also, in the extracurricular tutoring class, provincial and municipal extracurricular competition expenditure, also need to be supported by the financial resources of the family. For higher education, the advantages of the children of wealthy families are mainly reflected in professional choice, social practice, internship experience. These hidden resources have a vital role in future income. In the financial sector, for example, although the average salary of workers is higher, income uncertainty is also substantial. The average family children are often more willing to avoid risk, so the probability of choosing high-priced professional tuition is less.
